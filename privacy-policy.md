Effective Date: September 16, 2025

Unruggable ("we," "our," or "us") is an open-source, self-custodial wallet and hardware wallet connection app committed to user privacy and decentralization. This Privacy Policy explains our approach to data handling when you use our mobile application ("App") available on the Google Play Store. As a self-custodial tool, the App operates entirely on your device and interacts directly with public blockchain networks without collecting or storing any personal information.By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not access or use the App.

1. Information We Collect
We do not collect, store, or process any personal information about you. The App is designed to be fully self-custodial, meaning all wallet management, transactions, and data handling occur on your device or directly on public blockchains.

No Personal Data: We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, device ID, IP address, or any other identifiers.

Public On-Chain Data: The App may display or interact with publicly available blockchain data (e.g., transaction histories, wallet balances) that is inherently visible on decentralized networks. This data is not collected or stored by us; it is retrieved in real-time from public sources as needed for App functionality.
No Usage or Analytics Data: We do not track your interactions with the App, usage patterns, or any analytics. No third-party analytics tools are integrated.
Hardware Wallet Integration: When connecting to hardware wallets, all operations are handled locally on your device without transmitting data to our servers.

We do not collect any sensitive personal data under any circumstances.

2. How We Use Your InformationSince we do not collect any personal information, there is no usage of such data. The App's functionality relies solely on your device's processing and direct interactions with public blockchains or connected hardware wallets.

3. Sharing Your InformationWe do not collect any information to share. No data is sold, shared, or disclosed to third parties, service providers, or any other entities. In the event of business transfers, legal requirements, or other scenarios, there would be no personal data to transfer or disclose.

4. Third-Party ServicesThe App may integrate with third-party blockchain networks, hardware wallets, or open-source protocols. These integrations occur directly from your device, and we do not facilitate or monitor them. Third parties (e.g., blockchain nodes or hardware manufacturers) have their own privacy practices, which we encourage you to review. We are not responsible for their policies or actions.

5. Data SecurityAlthough we do not collect data, we prioritize security in the App's design. All operations are performed locally on your device. We recommend using secure practices, such as protecting your device and private keys. However, as with any software, absolute security cannot be guaranteed, and you use the App at your own risk.

6. Data RetentionWe do not retain any personal information, as none is collected.

7. Your Privacy RightsSince we do not collect or process any personal data, privacy rights such as access, correction, deletion, or portability do not apply. If you have questions about blockchain data (which is public and immutable), refer to the relevant network's documentation.For any inquiries, contact us at [Insert Contact Email, e.g., privacy@unruggable.com].

8. Children's PrivacyThe App is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or 16 in certain jurisdictions). We do not knowingly interact with children, and no data collection occurs regardless.

9. International Data TransfersNo personal data is collected or transferred, so this section does not apply. Blockchain interactions may involve global networks, but these are decentralized and outside our control.

10. Disclaimer and Limitations of LiabilityThe App is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee the App's uninterrupted operation, security, or fitness for any particular purpose. As a self-custodial wallet, you are solely responsible for managing and securing your private keys, seed phrases, and assets. We do not have access to your private keys or funds and cannot assist with recovery, restoration, or retrieval of lost assets under any circumstances.To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to loss of funds, data breaches, or third-party actions. You acknowledge that blockchain transactions are irreversible and that we bear no responsibility for any errors, losses, or thefts resulting from your use of the App or connected services.

11. Changes to This Privacy PolicyWe may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example, to reflect App updates or legal changes. We will notify you by posting the new policy on this page and updating the effective date. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.12.
